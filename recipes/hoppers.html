    <p>Yes, I know. Itâ€™s a bit tricky at first to make perfect bowl-shaped hoppers. But you can master the art within a few tries.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups rice (preferably parboiled or Sona Masuri rice)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup peeled black lentils</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast for fermentation</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>Water for soaking and for the dough consistency</li>
        <li>Coconut oil or vegetable oil for frying the appams</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice and urd beans thoroughly in a bowl and cover with plenty of water. Leave to soak overnight or for at least 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice and urd beans and process in a blender or food processor until smooth. Add a little water if necessary to achieve a thick consistency.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a large bowl and add the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Stir well to combine. Cover the dough and let it ferment in a warm place for at least 6-8 hours or overnight. The dough should rise and form bubbles.</li>
        <li>Before frying the appams, add the baking powder to the batter and stir thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Preheat an appam pan or a flat frying pan with a lid on medium heat. Grease it with a little coconut oil or vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Add a ladle of batter to the center of the pan and rotate it evenly in a circular manner to form a thin edge and a thicker center. Place the pan lid on top and fry the appam for about 2-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy around the edges while the center remains slightly fluffy.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the finished appams from the pan and keep them warm on a plate. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
