    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With beef mince, curry paste and slaw mix, this stir-fry is jam packed full of flavour, colour and texture. Better yet, it only takes three simple steps and 25 minutes to have this delicious and nutritious dish on the table.</p>
    <p>If you don't have roti, use up any leftover thin flatbread lurking in the pantry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
        <li>1 red onion, halved, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1⁄3 cup fresh curry leaves</li>
        <li>350g beef mince</li>
        <li>80g (1⁄3 cup) madras curry paste</li>
        <li>350g packet coleslaw mix</li>
        <li>2 roti, shredded</li>
        <li>1 long fresh green chilli, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tsp oil in a large non-stick frying pan or wok over high heat. Add the egg, swirling the pan to cover base. Cook for 2 minutes or until set. Slide onto a chopping board and coarsely chop.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tsp remaining oil in pan over high heat. Add onion and curry leaves. Stir-fry for 3 minutes or until the onion has softened. Add the beef and stir-fry for 4 minutes or until browned. Add the curry paste and stir-fry for 1 minute or until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in the pan over high heat. Add the coleslaw and stir-fry for 4 minutes. Add shredded roti and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Return the beef mixture to the pan and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until heated through and well combined. Season. Stir through the chopped omelette and sprinkle with the chilli to serve.</li>
